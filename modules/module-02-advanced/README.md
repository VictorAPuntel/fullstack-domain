# 🚀 Module 02 - Advanced

This module takes the foundation built in **Module 01 (Logic)** and pushes it further — focusing on **deep understanding**, **practical application**, and **real-world full-stack development**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

By completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Reinforce JavaScript fundamentals with applied logic
- Build interactive front-end applications (DOM & APIs)
- Develop and connect RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express
- Understand databases and ORM basics
- Structure full-stack projects with clean, maintainable code
